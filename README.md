# Credit Card Fraud Detection
Credit Card Fraud Detection project! In today's digital world, safeguarding financial transactions from fraud is paramount. Leveraging advanced machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree, our project is dedicated to detecting and preventing fraudulent activities with precision.

### About the Dataset
This is a simulated credit card transaction dataset containing legitimate and fraud transactions from the duration 1st Jan 2019 - 31st Dec 2020. It covers credit cards of 1000 customers doing transactions with a pool of 800 merchants.

### Requirements

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

1. NumPy
2. pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. seaborn
5. scikit-learn
6. logistic regression
7. decision tree classifier
8. random forest
9. accuracy score

### Objective
Build a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Use a dataset containing information about credit card transactions, and experiment with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.
